#Neurodata Without Borders file conversion Wizard README

This python script is a wizard which converts fluorescent imaging data and "McCormick style" data into Neurodata Without Borders format.  The Wizard can convert .tiff stacks and .mat Matlab files which contain long form data inside of structs.   The Wizard expects to receive experimental metadata from NWB formatted structs in the template .mat files.  Templates can be found in <folder>.

All Users:

When using this code, be aware that the Spike2 naming convention has been used to extract values from the structs.  The code on <line #> should be updated with your lab's naming conventions. If you want to adopt NWB naming conventions, this is a good starting place: https://pynwb.readthedocs.io/en/stable/pynwb.file.html#pynwb.file.NWBFile
